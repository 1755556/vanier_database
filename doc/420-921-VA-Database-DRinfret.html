<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>This course introduces the fundamental concepts of database design and database development. Using a relational database management system (RDBMS), students will learn to define, manipulate, and query a database. This course covers relational databases and the entity-relationship (ER) model, along with the Structured Query Language (SQL). In addition, students will learn how to establish data confidentiality (management of authorization), to process data ( stored procedure and scripts), and to save and restore a database.</p>
<h2 id="courses-role-in-the-program">Course’s role in the program</h2>
<p>This course introduces students to database concepts, design, and implementation. It emphasizes various features of a database management system. The fundamentals learned in this course will be vital for the students’ development throughout the program. This is a prerequisite course to the <em>Application Development 1: Desktop</em> course given in the third semester, and its content will be used and applied in almost all of fourth- and fifth-semester courses.</p>
<h2 id="statement-of-course-competencies">Statement of course competencies</h2>
<p>The competency <strong>00Q7 Use a database management system</strong> will be covered completely in this course.</p>
<h2 id="course-level-learning-outcome">Course-level Learning Outcome</h2>
<p>Students will contribute to a team-based database project that includes designing and implementing a real-world database, based on a data model and specification. Students will define and implement the database, load data to populate the tables, and write appropriate SQL queries to retrieve data and to answer relevant business questions.</p>
<h2 id="key-learning-outcomes">Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Use a database management system :</p>
<ul>
<li>Element 1: Create the database.</li>
<li>Element 2: Formulate read requests, insertion requests, modification requests and deletion requests.</li>
<li>Element 3: Ensure data confidentiality and consistency.</li>
<li>Element 4: Program automated data processing operations.</li>
<li>Element 5: Save and restore the database</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="required-reading-material-textbook">Required reading material (Textbook)</h2>
<p>There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture notes will be provided through Omnivox, along with a list of recommended readings and tutorials. The list will be updated throughout the course as needed.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late work</h3>
<p>A 10% penalty for each late day will be applied on assignments submitted after the deadline. The project (LIA) and the exam cannot be submitted late. Exceptions can only be granted only according to the College policies and procedures.</p>
<h2 id="project-learning-integration-assessment">Project (Learning Integration Assessment)</h2>
<p>A large project that is performed in groups of 2 or 3 students that makes use of the main concepts and practices covered in this course allows students to design and implement a real-life database. Based on a data model and specifications, students would define and implement the database, populate tables, and write appropriate SQL queries to retrieve relevant information.</p>
<p><em>Examples</em>: A project could be based on a database for a school, car-rental agency, hotel, library, human-resources department, banking accounts, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a conceptual model in the form of ERD including attributes, their types, and constraints on them</li>
<li>Identify any constraints that are not captured by the ERD</li>
<li>Translate the conceptual model into a relational schema</li>
<li>Implement the relational schema in SQL</li>
<li>Write SQL statements to alter a table and its constraints</li>
<li>Write SQL statements for data manipulation (insert, update, and delete)</li>
<li>Write appropriate queries to retrieve data</li>
<li>Write triggers/checks to maintain data integrity.</li>
<li>Produce the required documents (spool files, script files, project reports, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="evaluation-criteria-for-the-learning-integration-assessment">Evaluation criteria for the learning integration assessment</h3>
<p>The following criteria are considered in the evaluation of the project deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design:
